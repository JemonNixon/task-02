Amazon EC2 is a cloud-based service that allows us to launch and manage virtual servers (memory, network, and compute capacity), known as instances ,
which run on our chosen operating system and applications
Amazon EC2 combines CPU, RAM, and storage (disk) to create a virtual computing environment.EC2 is similar to our personal computer, but multiple users use it at different times. 
The term "elastic" refers to its ability to automatically scale up or down based on your workload needs, providing flexibility and cost-efficiency.

Why do we use EC2

In traditional on-premises setup, we must handle everything from checking hardware configurations and upgrading systems to ensuring security, but with Amazon EC2, AWS takes care of these tasks,
providing automatic updates, enhanced security, and scalability, so we can focus more on our applications and business needs.
